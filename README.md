# PowerBI_HR-Dashboards

### **Here's what we'll explore in this project:**

I will present four dashboards that showcase insights drawn from Glassdoor Gender Pay Gap data. While showing a static image of a dashboard is not ideal since it removes the interactive experience, Iâ€™ve attached the Power BI file so you can download it, open it in Power BI Desktop, plug in the dataset (see the link provided above), and explore it yourself. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

The four dashboards are:
 - 	**Demographics Dashboard:** Provides an overview of the workforce.
 - 	**Gender Pay Difference Dashboard**
 - 	**Key Influencers Analysis:** Uses AI to identify factors influencing base pay and bonus.
 - 	**Decomposition of Base Pay:** AI-powered feature that breaks down which factors contribute most to the results.

Please note, this is not a Gender Pay Gap analysis driven by the Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021. A separate repository will be dedicated to that project.
